# Application Installation README File

This README provides a guide on how to set up and run this Node.js application. This application requires the use of an API key from OpenAI to function properly.

## Usage
This application generates Cypress scripts for test automation by filling out web forms. You can access the application via its web interface. Please refer to the project's documentation or source code for specific usage instructions and endpoints.


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzzaamalik2/qatestcases.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd qatestcases
   ```

3. Install the required Node.js modules by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will download and install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Configuration

To configure this application, you need to set up an environment variable for your OpenAI API key. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the application if it doesn't already exist.

2. Inside the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `"xyz"` with your actual OpenAI API key:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   This environment variable is used to authenticate with the OpenAI API.

## Running the Application

To start the Node.js application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch the application, and it will use the API key you provided in the `.env` file to interact with the OpenAI API.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it via its API or web interface. Please refer to the project's documentation or source code for specific usage instructions and endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's documentation, or you can create an issue on the project's GitHub repository for assistance.
